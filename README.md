## Repository Structure

Below is an outline of the key components of the WebsiteGPT project:

### Main Files and Directories

- `index.js` - The main server file where the Express app is defined.
- `public/` - Directory for serving static files.
- `gpt/` - Subdirectory for the generated GPT files.

### Setup and Configuration

1. Import necessary modules like `express`, `fs`, `crypto`.
2. Define `__filename` and `__dirname` for ES module compatibility.
3. Set up directories for static files and create them if they don't exist.
4. Instantiate the Express app and define CORS middleware.
5. Implement the POST route for '/deploy' to handle GPT-generated content.
6. Serve static files from the 'public' directory.
7. Start the server on the specified port.

### Running the Project

To run WebsiteGPT on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Start the server with `npm start`.
5. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
